           Currently residing in Northeast Tennessee, I work as a full-time consultant remotely for
            <a href="https://www.graphable.ai/">Graphable.ai</a> where I lead data analytics projects

                Horiseon is a HW assignment I worked on at Vanderbilt University's full-stack web development program. When I began this assignment, the code was outdated and did not include assistive features, such as alt text for screen readers on images. Upon completion of this assignment the layout is improved and now includes assistive features.
